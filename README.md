# 🎮 Prime Gaming Club — Official Esports Website

Welcome to the **Prime Gaming Club** — a website I’m building from scratch for our esports community: **Prime Club**. This project is not just about writing code; it's about shaping a digital identity for a club that lives and breathes gaming. 

This is my personal journey into front-end development, and this README is as much about what I’ve built as it is about what I’ve learned.

## 🚀 About the Project

The **Prime Gaming Club Website** is a front-end project that showcases the vibe, energy, and spirit of an esports club. From stunning visuals to clean, modern layouts, everything is hand-crafted using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — no frameworks yet, just raw, foundational web development.

This is my take on how esports websites should feel — immersive, cinematic, and smooth.

## 🧠 What I've Learned (So Far)

This project has been a sandbox of experiments, breakthroughs, and small wins:

- 🎨 **Logo Design & SVG Conversion**  
  I designed the official Prime Club logo and converted it to **SVG** format for crisp rendering and easy styling. SVGs are powerful, and this was my first real dive into using vector graphics on the web.

- 🎥 **AI-Generated Background Video**  
  I wanted the homepage to *feel alive*, so I used an **AI-generated cinematic video** as a background hero section. It adds a bold, dynamic first impression.

- ☁️ **AWS S3 for Video Hosting**  
  Hosting media is a whole new world. I learned how to upload videos to an **Amazon S3 bucket**, manage permissions, and generate a public **MP4 link** that I could directly plug into my HTML. No YouTube embeds — just pure custom hosting.

- 🧼 **HTML & CSS for Clean Aesthetic**  
  My goal was a *classy, gamer-inspired look* — think of subtle gradients, sharp sections, hover effects, and a consistent theme. I focused on layout structure, responsive design, and keeping the codebase clean.
